### TASK 4 ###
Mock data for this project has been generated from https://www.mockaroo.com/

INSTRUCTIONS TO LOAD DATA INTO DATABASE

There are two ways to load data into database in this project. Use first one for around 10 values per table (less data) and second one if you need large data for each table (200 rows for each table).

1. load.sql
=> load the load.sql file in query tool of the pgadmin server and run it. We have included around 10 values for each table in this file.

2. load_csv.sql
=> we have around 200 dummy values for each table in separate csv files in the mock_data folder
=> open the load_csv.sql file using any text editor
=> change the path of the respective mock data csv files in this file with exact path of files in your system
=> copy the content of load_csv.sql file and paste it in psql command line (downloaded as part of Postgresql package)
=> data should be loaded in the database by now
